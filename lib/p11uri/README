The following files are taken from p11-kit 0.23.5.

- attrs.[ch]
- buffer.[ch]
- uri.[ch]
- url.[ch]

Local changes:

- "config.h" inclusion is guarded with HAVE_CONFIG_H

- attrs.[ch]
  * p11_attr{,s}_to_string, p11_attr{,s}_format, p11_attr_hash are not
    compiled, because it requires extra dependencies
- uri.c
  * The support for vendor query attributes are disabled, because it
    requires dependency on the hash table implementation in p11-kit.
  * call to p11_debug is commented out, because it does I/O.
